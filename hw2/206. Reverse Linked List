//題目修改自 Leetcode 206. Reverse Linked List
//Our company's software version control uses a linked list to keep track of changes, 
//meaning the latest record is inserted at the end of the linked list. 
//If we want to view the version history, we need to reverse the records. How do you think you would handle this?
typedef struct ListNode{
    int val;
    struct ListNode* next;
} listnode;

listnode* reverselist(listnode* head){
    listnode* temp = head;
    listnode* ans = NULL;
    
    while (temp) {
        listnode* next = temp->next;
        temp->next = ans;
        ans = temp;
        temp = next;
    }
    return ans;
}
